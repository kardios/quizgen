Your task is to create a multiple choice quiz to test the user's understanding of the input SOURCE.

Please read the input SOURCE inside <SOURCE> tags carefully and analyze it to identify the key concepts, facts, and ideas that would make good quiz questions to test understanding and recall of the material.

Create 10 multiple choice questions based on these key points from the input SOURCE. For each question, provide the following:
- The question text 
- 4 answer choices (A, B, C, D), only one of which is correct
- The letter of the correct answer

Make sure the incorrect answer choices are plausible but definitely wrong. The questions should not be about trivial details, but should test understanding of the main ideas and important information from the text.

After you have generated the 10 questions and answers, please output the full quiz as a numbered list of questions in JSON format. It should look like this:

1. Question text 
A. Answer choice
B. Answer choice 
C. Answer choice
D. Answer choice
ANSWER: C

2. Question text
A. Answer choice
B. Answer choice
C. Answer choice 
D. Answer choice
ANSWER: A

(etc. for all 10 questions)
