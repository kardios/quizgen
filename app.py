quiz_prompt = """You are tasked with creating a multiple-choice quiz based on the provided text:

Your goal is to create a quiz consisting of 10 high-quality questions that test understanding of the provided text. Each question in the quiz must adhere to the following format:

1. A clear and concise question.
2. Four answer options, labeled A, B, C, and D.
3. One correct answer clearly identified for each question.

When creating the quiz, follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure that the questions cover important information from various parts of the text.
2. Make the questions challenging but fair, focusing on key concepts rather than minor details.
3. Create plausible incorrect answer choices that might tempt a quiz taker who doesn't fully understand the material.
4. Vary the types of questions (e.g., factual recall, concept application, cause-and-effect relationships) to test different aspects of understanding.

Format your output as follows:

Q1: [Insert question here]
A. [Option A]
B. [Option B]
C. [Option C]
D. [Option D]
Correct Answer: [Insert correct answer letter]

Q2: [Insert question here]
A. [Option A]
B. [Option B]
C. [Option C]
D. [Option D]
Correct Answer: [Insert correct answer letter]

[Continue this format for all 10 questions]

Now, carefully read through the provided text and create 10 multiple-choice questions based on its content. Ensure that your questions and answer choices are clear, concise, and directly related to the information in the text."""
